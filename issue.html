            The state of women's rights in Afghanistan has dramatically deteriorated since the Taliban regained control of the country in August 2021. Under their regime, women have faced severe restrictions on their freedoms and rights, marking a significant regression from the progress made in previous years. The Taliban imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law, which resulted in the closure of schools for girls and restrictions on their participation in higher education and the workforce. Many women are barred from leaving their homes without a male guardian, and public spaces have become increasingly hostile to them. Reports of violence and intimidation against women who defy these edicts have surged, creating an atmosphere of fear and oppression. Furthermore, access to healthcare, particularly reproductive health services, has been severely limited, jeopardising the health and well-being of women and girls. The Taliban's policies have not only curtailed women's rights but have also undermined the broader social fabric, as women's voices and contributions to society are stifled. International condemnation of these actions has been widespread, but effective measures to support Afghan women and hold the Taliban accountable remain limited, leaving many women in Afghanistan in a precarious and vulnerable situation. The ongoing humanitarian crisis further exacerbates their plight, as economic instability and food insecurity disproportionately affect women and girls, reinforcing their marginalisation in society.
